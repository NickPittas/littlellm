# Agentic Tool Calling Implementation

## Problem Identified

The LLM system was cutting off conversations after the first tool execution, preventing agentic behavior where models should be able to:

1. **Use one tool**
2. **Analyze the results**  
3. **Decide to use additional tools**
4. **Continue the conversation naturally**

### Example of the Issue

**User Request:** "Can you see at context7 a good react component for round cornered buttons? Give me a list of the top 3"

**What Happened:**
1. ✅ Model uses `resolve-library-id` tool
2. ❌ **CONVERSATION STOPS** - Model says "Let me try a different approach" but can't use more tools
3. ❌ No follow-up tool calls allowed

**What Should Happen:**
1. ✅ Model uses `resolve-library-id` tool
2. ✅ Model analyzes results and decides to use `get-library-docs` tool
3. ✅ Model continues with additional searches if needed
4. ✅ Model provides comprehensive answer

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the **follow-up call implementations** across all providers:

### 1. **Explicit Tool Disabling**
```typescript
// LM Studio (line 1204-1206)
tools: undefined,
tool_choice: undefined

// Ollama (line 911)  
// Note: NO tools parameter for follow-up calls

// OpenAI Compatible (line 234)
{ role: 'system', content: 'Based on the tool results provided, give a helpful and natural response...' }
```

### 2. **Single-Shot Execution Pattern**
- Execute tools once
- Make follow-up call **without tools**
- Expect final response
- **No iterative tool calling**

### 3. **Final Response Mindset**
System prompts instructed models to provide final answers rather than continue using tools.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced System Prompts**

**Before:**
```typescript
{ role: 'system', content: 'Based on the tool results provided, give a helpful and natural response to the user\'s question.' }
```

**After:**
```typescript
{ role: 'system', content: 'You are a helpful AI assistant. You have access to tools and can use them as needed to help the user. Based on the tool results provided, continue the conversation naturally. If you need to use additional tools to better answer the user\'s question, feel free to do so.' }
```

### 2. **Tools Enabled in Follow-Up Calls**

**OpenAI Compatible Providers:**
```typescript
const followUpRequestBody = {
  model: settings.model,
  messages: followUpMessages,
  temperature: settings.temperature,
  max_tokens: settings.maxTokens,
  stream: false,
  // NEW: Include tools to allow continued agentic behavior
  ...(availableTools.length > 0 && {
    tools: availableTools,
    tool_choice: 'auto'
  })
};
```

**Ollama:**
```typescript
const requestBody = {
  model: settings.model,
  messages: ollamaMessages,
  stream: !!onStream,
  options: {
    temperature: settings.temperature,
    num_predict: settings.maxTokens
  },
  // NEW: Include tools for agentic behavior if available
  ...(tools.length > 0 && { tools })
};
```

### 3. **Recursive Tool Call Detection**

**OpenAI Compatible:**
```typescript
// Check if the follow-up response contains additional tool calls (agentic behavior)
if (followUpMessage?.tool_calls && followUpMessage.tool_calls.length > 0) {
  console.log(`🔄 ${providerName} follow-up response contains ${followUpMessage.tool_calls.length} additional tool calls - continuing agentic workflow`);
  
  // Recursively execute additional tool calls
  return this.executeToolsAndFollowUp(
    followUpMessage.tool_calls,
    followUpMessage.content || '',
    followUpData.usage,
    settings,
    provider,
    [...conversationHistory, ...toolResults],
    onStream,
    providerName,
    executeMCPTool,
    additionalHeaders,
    getMCPTools
  );
}
```

**Ollama/LM Studio:**
```typescript
// Check for additional tool calls in the follow-up response (agentic behavior)
if (enableTools && fullContent) {
  const toolCalls = this.parseToolCallsFromText(fullContent);
  if (toolCalls.length > 0) {
    console.log(`🔄 Ollama follow-up response contains ${toolCalls.length} additional tool calls - continuing agentic workflow`);
    // Recursively execute additional tool calls
    return this.executeTextBasedTools(toolCalls, fullContent, usage, settings, provider, messages, onStream);
  }
}
```

## Expected Behavior Now

### Example Workflow

**User:** "Can you see at context7 a good react component for round cornered buttons? Give me a list of the top 3"

**New Agentic Flow:**
1. ✅ Model uses `resolve-library-id` tool to find Context7
2. ✅ Model analyzes results and uses `get-library-docs` tool to get documentation
3. ✅ Model searches for button components in the docs
4. ✅ Model may use additional search tools if needed
5. ✅ Model provides comprehensive list of top 3 components

### Multi-Tool Scenarios

**Research Tasks:**
- Web search → Follow-up searches → Document analysis → Final synthesis

**Development Tasks:**
- Code search → Documentation lookup → Example retrieval → Implementation guidance

**Data Analysis:**
- Data retrieval → Processing → Visualization → Interpretation

## Benefits

1. **True Agentic Behavior**: Models can now work autonomously with multiple tools
2. **Better User Experience**: More comprehensive and accurate responses
3. **Reduced User Intervention**: No need to manually prompt for additional searches
4. **Enhanced Problem Solving**: Models can break down complex tasks naturally
5. **Improved Accuracy**: Multiple tool calls lead to better informed responses

## Technical Notes

- **Performance**: Recursive calls are optimized to prevent infinite loops
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling at each tool execution level
- **Context Management**: Proper conversation history maintenance
- **Provider Agnostic**: Works consistently across all LLM providers
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing single-tool workflows continue to work

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with:
- ✅ Multi-step research queries
- ✅ Complex development questions requiring multiple tools
- ✅ Sequential tool dependencies
- ✅ Error recovery and fallback scenarios
- ✅ All supported LLM providers

This fix transforms the LiteLLM system from a single-tool execution model to a truly agentic AI assistant capable of autonomous multi-tool workflows! 🚀

## CRITICAL UPDATE: Provider-Specific System Prompts

### Additional Issue Discovered

The initial fix enabled agentic tool calling but was using **generic system prompts** in follow-up calls instead of the **provider-specific enhanced prompts** that include detailed tool instructions.

### Problem with Generic Prompts

**Before Fix:**
```typescript
// Generic follow-up prompt (all providers)
{ role: 'system', content: 'You are a helpful AI assistant. You have access to tools...' }
```

**What Should Happen:**
```typescript
// Provider-specific enhanced prompt with tool instructions
const enhancedPrompt = this.enhanceSystemPromptWithTools(basePrompt, tools);
// Includes detailed tool categorization, usage patterns, and provider-specific formatting
```

### Provider-Specific Prompt Systems

Each provider has sophisticated prompt engineering:

1. **`getSystemPrompt()`** - Base system prompt
2. **`enhanceSystemPromptWithTools()`** - Adds tool-specific instructions
3. **Provider-specific generators**:
   - `generateAnthropicToolPrompt()` - XML-style tool calling
   - `generateDeepSeekToolPrompt()` - Complex tool instructions
   - `generateOllamaToolPrompt()` - Agentic workflow system
   - `generateOpenAIToolPrompt()` - Structured tool categorization
   - etc.

### Complete Fix Implementation

**1. OpenAI Compatible Streaming Enhanced**
```typescript
// Added getEnhancedSystemPrompt parameter
static async executeToolsAndFollowUp(
  // ... existing parameters
  getEnhancedSystemPrompt?: (tools: unknown[]) => string
): Promise<LLMResponse>

// Build provider-specific enhanced system prompt
if (getEnhancedSystemPrompt && availableTools.length > 0) {
  followUpSystemPrompt = getEnhancedSystemPrompt(availableTools);
  followUpSystemPrompt += `\n\n## Follow-up Context\n\nBased on the tool results provided above, continue the conversation naturally...`;
}
```

**2. All Providers Updated**
- **DeepSeek**: Passes `enhanceSystemPromptWithTools` function
- **Requesty**: Passes `enhanceSystemPromptWithTools` function
- **Anthropic**: Uses `getAnthropicTools` and `enhanceSystemPromptWithTools`
- **Ollama**: Updates system message with enhanced prompt
- **LM Studio**: Updates system message with enhanced prompt

**3. Proper Tool Instructions Preserved**

Now follow-up calls include:
- ✅ **Tool categorization** (🔍 Search, 🧠 Memory, 📁 Files, etc.)
- ✅ **Usage patterns** (parallel vs sequential execution)
- ✅ **Provider-specific formatting** (XML for Anthropic, JSON for Ollama, etc.)
- ✅ **Strategic guidance** (when to use tools vs conversation)
- ✅ **Multi-tool execution rules**

### Result: True Agentic Behavior

**Before Complete Fix:**
- ❌ Generic prompts in follow-up calls
- ❌ Lost tool instruction context
- ❌ Inconsistent tool usage patterns

**After Complete Fix:**
- ✅ Provider-specific enhanced prompts in all calls
- ✅ Full tool instruction context preserved
- ✅ Consistent agentic behavior across providers
- ✅ Proper tool categorization and usage guidance

This ensures that when models make follow-up tool calls, they have the **same detailed instructions** as the initial call, maintaining consistent agentic behavior throughout the conversation! 🎯

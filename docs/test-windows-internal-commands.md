# Windows Internal Commands Test Plan

## Overview
This document outlines comprehensive testing for internal commands on Windows to ensure they work properly with PowerShell and Windows-specific features.

## Test Categories

### 1. Terminal Commands (PowerShell)
**Commands to test:**
- `start_process` - Start PowerShell processes
- `read_process_output` - Read output from running processes
- `interact_with_process` - Send input to processes
- `list_processes` - List system processes
- `kill_process` - Terminate processes

**Test Cases:**
1. **Basic PowerShell Command**
   - Command: `Get-Date`
   - Expected: Current date and time
   
2. **Directory Listing**
   - Command: `Get-ChildItem`
   - Expected: List of files in current directory
   
3. **System Information**
   - Command: `Get-ComputerInfo | Select-Object WindowsProductName,WindowsVersion`
   - Expected: Windows version information
   
4. **Process Management**
   - Command: `Get-Process | Select-Object -First 5 Name,Id,CPU`
   - Expected: Top 5 processes with details

### 2. Filesystem Commands
**Commands to test:**
- `read_file` - Read file contents
- `write_file` - Write to files
- `create_directory` - Create directories
- `list_directory` - List directory contents
- `move_file` - Move/rename files
- `delete_file` - Delete files (with recycle bin support)
- `get_file_info` - Get file metadata

**Test Cases:**
1. **File Operations**
   - Create test file: `test-file.txt`
   - Write content: "Hello Windows!"
   - Read content back
   - Move file to new location
   - Delete file (should go to recycle bin on Windows)

2. **Directory Operations**
   - Create directory: `test-dir`
   - List contents
   - Create subdirectory
   - Remove directory

3. **Windows Path Handling**
   - Test with backslashes: `C:\Users\...`
   - Test with forward slashes: `C:/Users/...`
   - Test with UNC paths: `\\server\share`

### 3. System Commands
**Commands to test:**
- `get_cpu_usage` - CPU utilization
- `get_memory_usage` - Memory statistics
- `get_system_info` - System information

**Test Cases:**
1. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Get CPU usage (should use PowerShell WMI)
   - Get memory usage (should use PowerShell CIM)
   - Get system info (should include Windows-specific data)

### 4. Text Editing Commands
**Commands to test:**
- `find_and_replace` - Text replacement
- `format_text` - Text formatting

**Test Cases:**
1. **Text Processing**
   - Create file with sample text
   - Find and replace operations
   - Format text with different options

## Windows-Specific Considerations

### PowerShell Integration
- Default shell should be `powershell`
- Commands should use PowerShell syntax
- Error handling for PowerShell-specific errors

### Path Handling
- Support for Windows path separators (`\`)
- Handle drive letters (`C:`, `D:`, etc.)
- Support for UNC paths
- Handle spaces in paths properly

### File System Features
- Recycle bin integration for file deletion
- NTFS permissions and attributes
- Windows file locking behavior

### Security
- PowerShell execution policy considerations
- UAC and privilege escalation
- Blocked commands for security

## Expected Behavior

### Success Indicators
- Commands execute without errors
- Output is properly formatted
- Windows-specific features work (recycle bin, PowerShell, etc.)
- Proper error handling for Windows-specific issues

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of PowerShell errors
- Proper error messages for permission issues
- Timeout handling for long-running commands

## Test Execution Steps

1. **Enable Internal Commands**
   - Go to Settings → Internal Commands
   - Enable internal commands
   - Verify all command categories are enabled

2. **Test Basic Functionality**
   - Test simple PowerShell commands
   - Verify output formatting
   - Check error handling

3. **Test File Operations**
   - Create, read, write, delete files
   - Test with various file types
   - Verify recycle bin functionality

4. **Test System Integration**
   - Test system information commands
   - Verify performance monitoring
   - Check process management

5. **Test Edge Cases**
   - Long file paths
   - Special characters in paths
   - Large files
   - Network paths

## Known Issues to Watch For

1. **PowerShell Execution Policy**
   - May need to adjust execution policy
   - Could affect script execution

2. **Path Encoding**
   - Unicode characters in paths
   - Special characters handling

3. **Permissions**
   - UAC restrictions
   - File system permissions
   - Process access rights

4. **Performance**
   - PowerShell startup time
   - Large output handling
   - Memory usage with large files

## Success Criteria

✅ All basic commands execute successfully
✅ PowerShell integration works properly
✅ File operations handle Windows paths correctly
✅ Recycle bin integration functions
✅ System commands return valid data
✅ Error handling is appropriate
✅ Performance is acceptable

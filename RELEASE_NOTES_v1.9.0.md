# LittleLLM v1.9.0 Release Notes

## üéâ What's New in Version 1.9.0

### üîß **Major Bug Fixes**

#### **Fixed Chat Window Visibility Issues with Global Shortcuts**
- **Issue**: When using the global hide/show shortcut, the chat window would not restore properly after being hidden
- **Root Causes Fixed**:
  - Global shortcut only restored the main window, ignoring chat window state
  - No state tracking for previously open chat windows
  - "Open Chat" button could become unresponsive after global hide/show cycles

#### **Improvements Made**:
1. **Added Chat Window State Tracking**
   - System now remembers if the chat window was open before global hide
   - Ensures proper restoration during global show operations

2. **Enhanced Global Shortcut Logic**
   - Modified global shortcut handler to track chat window visibility before hiding
   - Added logic to restore chat window during global show if it was previously visible
   - Chat window now properly restores along with the main window

3. **Improved Open Chat Button Reliability**
   - Updated the "Open Chat" button to always show the chat window, even if it exists but is hidden
   - Button now works unconditionally regardless of previous hide/show cycles
   - Maintains all existing functionality while ensuring reliability

#### **Expected Behavior Now**:
- ‚úÖ **Global Hide**: Both main and chat windows hide, system remembers chat window state
- ‚úÖ **Global Show**: Both main and chat windows restore if chat was previously visible
- ‚úÖ **Open Chat Button**: Always works to show/open chat window regardless of previous state
- ‚úÖ **Message Sending**: Continues to auto-open chat window when sending messages

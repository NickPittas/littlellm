Please remove the horizontal scroll bar that appears when I open the models dropdown from the bottom panel. Hide it.
Please add tokens per second, on the resply of each model, and also add the total tokens used in the chat, and the total tokens used in the session.
Please add a button to the bottom panel that will allow the user to reset the chat.
Please add the ability for the user to add mcp servers, and a way for the models to use them.
Research how to add mcp support, and 
Add another dropdown in the bottom toolbar that will show the installed mcp server and enable or disable them with a checkbox or a on/off button per chat.
The mcp servers should be saved in an mcp.json file, same as the settings file, and in the settings panel, we should be able to enable, disable, and also edit in a text editor inside the panel.
